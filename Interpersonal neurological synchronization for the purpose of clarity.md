INS can help establish clarity in life.
because lack of INS or negative-INS exists, it is dangerous to exist outside of INS.
negative-INS can be thought of as a lingering bad vibe that a person carries and snowballs.
negative INS is literal confusion and dysphoria.
people naturally oppose negative INS becuase it is instinctually dangerous, therefore it snowballs on the people inflicted.
	people treat arrogant people negatively, because they are arrogant. 
	if an arrogant person meets a person for 5mins only then he will have gone a whole day with negative treatment but everyone else had only a 5min negative experience.
negative INS requires interventions before the mind degrades into a-point-of-difficult-return.
