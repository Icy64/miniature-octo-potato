to begin I will first acknowledge that while this claim is seemingly absurd, it is backed by physics. and a certain document.

people tend to think we live in a [[3+1 dimension]] with the +1 being time. I purpose there is an additional one making it a 3+2 reality. this extra one is called the vibe dimension or the v-dimension for short. it is a ethereal plane similar to the 3 dimensional space we are used to. except where atoms take volume it instead has intention and confidence, and logic. 

everything contains logic, from your blender controller, your computer, your pets, 

in a plane where things are valued based on logic instead of mass.

so some object contains clear inducing traits and behaviors. they are contained in walls that structure these behaviors to be useful and percise. [[logical walls]] are objects with traits that induce confusion or a sense of rigidness. this prevents clear inducing objects from passing through, similar to a resistor. for the sake of simplicity I will refer to anything clarity-friendly as a "brain".

- intention x confidence = momentum in the v realm.
- confidence and logic are related. confidence is based in logic.
- perception resides in the v realm, we are simply "plugged in" to the w-realm.
	- the w-realm is short form for normal 3+1 dimensional reality
- all things are connected inside the v realm
	- all things behave like a gas, and fill up space on the walls of a container
	- air and lack of eyesight also can act as a wall
- holes exist, similar to blackholes and perfect vacuums.
- the blackhole punctures the system. same with the v-realm analogy
	- a blackhole would be called a "super-brain"
	- a perfect vacuum would be called a "super-wall"
- a super-brain would induce clarity to its enviroment so much that the system wouldn't know what to do.
	- what happens when we reach clarity level 100.0000000000001?
- therefore the system requires a deity. an all powerful being that can decide.
	- allah or god must exist.
	- islam is the scientific religion focused on inducing clarity at minimal expense.
- a super-brain can take everyone to jannah if they don't mind.
	- everyone secretly wants to go to jannah.
%%- a super-brain can take form in anyshape, but should be pure from confusion causing elements. pure brain.
	- such a super-brain would allow us to interface with the v-realm.%%
